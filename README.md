# Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Docker Set-Up
You can use Docker to simplify setup and maintain consistent environments for both development and production. If you have Docker installed, you can start the entire application with a few commands.

2. Download only the docker-compose.yml file to your computer.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file.
4. Run the following command to start all services defined in the Docker Compose file:

###  `docker-compose up`

Access the application on:
